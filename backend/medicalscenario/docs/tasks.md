# Medical Scenario Application Improvement Tasks

## Architecture and Design

1. [x] Implement a consistent layered architecture (Controller -> Service -> Repository) for all features
   - [x] Create a TeamSummaryService to handle business logic currently in TeamSummaryController
   - [x] Move direct repository access from controllers to service classes

2. [x] Add proper exception handling
   - [x] Create a global exception handler (@ControllerAdvice)
   - [x] Define custom exceptions for different error scenarios
   - [x] Implement consistent error responses across the application

3. [x] Implement proper API documentation
   - [x] Add Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
   - [x] Document all endpoints with descriptions, parameters, and response types
   - [x] Create a README.md with project overview and setup instructions

4. [ ] Improve security measures
   - [ ] Implement authentication and authorization (Spring Security)
   - [ ] Move database credentials to environment variables or a secure vault
   - [ ] Add input validation for all endpoints
   - [ ] Implement CSRF protection

## Code Quality

5. [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
   - [ ] Unit tests for service classes
   - [ ] Integration tests for repositories
   - [ ] API tests for controllers
   - [ ] Add test coverage reporting

6. [ ] Implement logging
   - [ ] Add structured logging throughout the application
   - [ ] Configure different log levels for development and production
   - [ ] Log important events and errors

7. [ ] Improve code organization
   - [ ] Add DTOs to separate API models from entity models
   - [ ] Use mappers (like MapStruct) to convert between DTOs and entities
   - [ ] Add validation annotations to DTOs

8. [ ] Enhance error handling in service layer
   - [ ] Add more specific error messages
   - [ ] Implement proper transaction management
   - [ ] Add retry mechanisms for database operations where appropriate

## Features and Functionality

9. [ ] Enhance TeamSummary functionality
   - [ ] Add filtering and sorting capabilities
   - [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets
   - [ ] Add endpoints to get summaries by scenarioId or teamName

10. [ ] Improve ScenarioControl features
    - [ ] Add batch operations for scenario controls
    - [ ] Implement audit logging for scenario control changes
    - [ ] Add more metadata to scenario controls (description, difficulty, etc.)

11. [ ] Add user management
    - [ ] Create user entity and related components
    - [ ] Implement user registration and login
    - [ ] Add role-based access control

12. [ ] Implement data export functionality
    - [ ] Add endpoints to export team summaries as CSV/Excel
    - [ ] Implement scheduled reports generation
    - [ ] Add email notifications for important events

## Performance and Scalability

13. [ ] Optimize database queries
    - [ ] Add indexes to frequently queried fields
    - [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
    - [ ] Review and optimize JPA/Hibernate configurations

14. [ ] Improve application startup
    - [ ] Optimize bean initialization
    - [ ] Consider lazy loading where appropriate
    - [ ] Review and optimize database initialization

15. [ ] Prepare for scalability
    - [ ] Containerize the application (Docker)
    - [ ] Create Kubernetes deployment configurations
    - [ ] Implement health checks and readiness probes

## DevOps and CI/CD

16. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
    - [ ] Configure automated builds
    - [ ] Implement automated testing in the pipeline
    - [ ] Set up automated deployments

17. [ ] Add monitoring and observability
    - [ ] Implement metrics collection (Micrometer/Prometheus)
    - [ ] Set up centralized logging (ELK stack)
    - [ ] Configure alerting for critical issues

18. [ ] Improve build and deployment process
    - [ ] Create separate configurations for different environments
    - [ ] Implement database migration tools (Flyway/Liquibase)
    - [ ] Add version management for APIs
